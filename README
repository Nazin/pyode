PyODE - Python-ODE Interface

Introduction
PyODE provides an object-orientated python interface to the ODE pysics engine (http://opende.sourceforge.net).

API
The PyODE API is much like the ODE API except that it has been object-orientated so that all ODE's functions (in the form of d<Object><Method>(<ID>, <args>) correspond to <Object>.<Method>(args). E.g:

	ODE				PyODE
	dWorldCreate(id)		w = World()
	dBodyCreate(id, world)		b = Body(w)

Case
PyODE methods names begin with a lower-case letter and each word has upper-case first letter thereafter.

Vectors, Quaternions and Matricies
All vectors, quaternions and matricies are represented by tuples in PyODE. Unlike ODE, dVector3's are not given by three separate arguments but by one tuple. E.g:

	ODE				PyODE
	dVector3			(x,y,z)
	dQuaternion			(n1,n2,n3,n4)
	dMatrix3			( (a, b, c),
					  (d, e, f),
					  (g, h, i) )

	dWorldSetGravity(id, x, y, z)	w.setGravity( (x,y,z) )
