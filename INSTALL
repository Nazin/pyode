Installation instructions for all systems
=========================================

Requirements:
-------------

- Python v2.2 (or higher)
  http://www.python.org/

- ODE 0.5
  http://ode.org/

- Pyrex 0.9.3 (or higher)
  http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/
  This is only required for PyODE development; you don't need it to install
  and run PyODE.

Installation:
-------------

The package uses the Python distutils, so you can build it by calling

  python setup.py build

and install it by calling

  python setup.py install

which installs the package on your system.
See the "Installing Python Modules" manual inside your Python documentation
or at http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html if you want to customize the
build process or the target location.


Note: It is assumed that the ODE library is already compiled and installed
somewhere on your system. The setup script will try to find the ODE
installation on your system by trying several common locations. However, if the
installation can not be found, you will have to modify the variables ODE_BASE
and/or USER_SETTINGS at the top of the setup.py script to point to the
installation.

ODE can either be compiled with or without trimesh support. The setup script
checks your ODE user-settings file to determine whether is is supported. If
trimesh support disabled, PyODE's TriMeshData and GeomTriMesh classes will
still be there but they will raise a NotImplementedError exception in their
constructor. If you want to force PyODE to install with trimesh support
regardless of your ODE user-settings, uncomment the variable
TRIMESH_SUPPORT_OVERRIDE in setup.py.
