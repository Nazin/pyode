Installation instructions for all systems
=========================================

Requirements: 
-------------

- Python v2.2 (or higher) 
  http://www.python.org/

- Pyrex 0.9.3 (or higher) 
  http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/

- ODE 0.5
  http://ode.org/


Installation:
-------------

The package uses the Python distutils, so you can build it by calling

  python setup.py build

and install it by calling

  python setup.py install

which installs the package on your system. 
See the "Installing Python Modules" manual inside your Python documentation 
or at http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html if you want to customize the
build process or the target location.


Note: It is assumed that the ODE library is already compiled and installed
somewhere on your system. In the setup script there's a variable ODE_BASE
that points to the base ODE directory. It might be possible that you have
to modify this variable so that it points to the actual location on your
system.
